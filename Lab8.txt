1.	Area of a Rectangle 
Program (arithmetic.pl): 
area_rectangle(Length, Breadth, Area) :- Area is Length * Breadth. 
 
This rule computes the area of a rectangle by multiplying length and breadth using the is predicate. 
Sample Query & Output: 
?- area_rectangle(5, 8, Area). 
Area = 40 
2.	Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion 
Program (arithmetic.pl): 
celsius_to_fahrenheit(C, F) :- F is C * 9 / 5 + 32. 
 
This rule converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the standard conversion formula. 
Sample Query & Output: 
?- celsius_to_fahrenheit(25, F). 
F = 77.0 
3. Factorial Calculation 
Program (arithmetic.pl): 
factorial(0, 1). 
factorial(N, Result) :- 
    N > 0, 
    N1 is N - 1,     factorial(N1, SubResult), 
    Result is N * SubResult. 
 
This program recursively computes the factorial of a number using arithmetic operations and recursive rule invocation. 
Sample Query & Output: 
?- factorial(5, F). 
F = 120
